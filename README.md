# Trainingplan

Trainingplan is a simple desktop application written in Java developed during the Software Development 2 course in winter semester 2022 in university. The application displays the trainingplan for each day of the week.

## Features 
Trainingplan has the following features: 

- display the training plan for the selected day
- create their own profile
- add a new exercise
- navigate through the dialog for creating their own exercise (the funcionality is missing) 

## How to Use
The main methode is located in the class de.hdmstuttgart.controller.HelloApplication. The programm is in the folder Trainingplan.

## Technology Used
Trainingplan was built using the following technologies: 
- Java
- FXML

## TODOs: 
Trainingplan is just a small study project and there are still bugs and missing functionalities: 

**Bugs:** 
- if going back from the create-exercise-screen to the trainingplan, the exercises are no longer displayed 

**Missing Features:**
- change the age in the profile
- add a photo in the profile
- add their own exercises to the category lists and the trainingplans
- UI-Tests 

**Ohter improvements:**
- we should use a hashmap with the scenes in it instead of using the 'switchTo'-mthode and always build the scenes anew
